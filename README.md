# Card-Detection-and-Data-Extraction-Project
The Card Detection and Data Extraction Project aims to develop an automated system capable of accurately identifying various types of cards (such as Aadhar cards, PAN cards, etc.) from images or video streams. The system will then extract relevant information (such as text, numbers, and other data) from these detected cards and save it in Excel.
